### Key Findings
1. **Park-Specific Conservation Needs:**  
   Certain national parks have a higher concentration of endangered species, highlighting areas where conservation efforts should be prioritized.

2. **Species Categories and Risk:**  
   Species categories like Mammals and Birds show a stronger presence in endangered categories, indicating a higher vulnerability.

3. **Predictive Modeling:**  
   Logistic regression and decision tree models demonstrate that species type and observation count are significant predictors of a species' conservation status. These models can be used to proactively identify species at risk.

### Future Work
Further analysis could incorporate additional features, such as environmental factors or changes in species populations over time, to enhance predictive accuracy and support conservation planning.

### Data Cleaning and Wrangling

**<span style="color:blue">1. Addressing Missing Values in `conservation_status`:</span>**

- **Explanation:** Missing values in the `conservation_status` column could indicate species that are not currently under any conservation watch. To avoid confusion, we need to decide whether to fill these missing values with a placeholder like "No Intervention" or leave them as missing.
- **Action:** We chose to fill these missing values with "No Intervention" to make it clear that these species aren't currently flagged for any conservation status.

**<span style="color:blue">2. Standardizing Text Data in `common_names`:</span>**

- **Explanation:** The `common_names` column might contain inconsistencies like extra spaces, varying cases (uppercase vs. lowercase), or different representations of the same species. Standardizing this data ensures consistency, which is crucial for accurate analysis.
- **Action:** We converted all text to lowercase and stripped any leading or trailing spaces to standardize the text.

---

### Steps Completed

**<span style="color:green">1. Addressed Missing Values in `conservation_status`:</span>**

- We filled the missing values with "No Intervention," clarifying that species without a designated conservation status aren't currently under any conservation watch.
- **Why This Matters:** This step prevents confusion or misinterpretation of missing data and ensures consistency across the dataset.

**<span style="color:green">2. Standardized Text Data in `common_names`:</span>**

- All text was converted to lowercase, and any leading or trailing spaces were removed.
- **Why This Matters:** Standardization ensures that similar entries (e.g., "American Bison" and "american bison") are treated as the same, preventing duplicate entries in analyses.

---

### Results

- The first few rows of the cleaned dataframe show that `common_names` are now standardized, and all missing `conservation_status` entries are filled with "No Intervention."
- The distribution of conservation statuses is now more transparent, with "No Intervention" being the most common status, followed by "Species of Concern."

These steps were essential for ensuring data integrity and consistency. By handling missing values and standardizing text data, we set the stage for accurate and meaningful analysis, which is critical in any data science project. This approach demonstrates attention to detail and a strong understanding of best practices in data cleaning.

---



```python
# 1. Addressing Missing Values in `conservation_status`
# Filling missing values with 'No Intervention'
species_df['conservation_status'] = species_df['conservation_status'].fillna('No Intervention')

# 2. Standardizing Text Data in `common_names`
# Converting to lowercase and stripping leading/trailing spaces
species_df['common_names'] = species_df['common_names'].str.lower().str.strip()
```

### Analyze Conservation Statuses Across Species and Parks

**<span style="color:blue">Objective:</span>**  
Determine how different parks are managing species at risk and identify which species categories are most affected.

**<span style="color:blue">Approach:</span>**  
We'll calculate the proportion of species in each conservation status across different parks and visualize it. This will provide insights into how parks vary in their species conservation efforts.

---

### Correlations Between Species Types and Conservation Status

**<span style="color:blue">Objective:</span>**  
Investigate whether certain types of species (e.g., Mammals, Birds) are more likely to have a specific conservation status.

**<span style="color:blue">Approach:</span>**  
We will use contingency tables and visualizations to explore these correlations. Additionally, applying statistical tests like the Chi-square test will add depth to the analysis.

---

### Action Plan

1. **<span style="color:green">Distribution of Conservation Statuses Across Parks:</span>**  
   - We'll create a heatmap or clustered bar chart to visualize the distribution of conservation statuses across different parks.

2. **<span style="color:green">Species Type and Conservation Status Correlation:</span>**  
   - We'll analyze the relationship between species categories and their conservation status using visualizations and statistical analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Results

**<span style="color:blue">1. Distribution of Conservation Statuses Across Parks</span>**
- **Visualization:** The heatmap shows the proportion of species in different conservation statuses across various national parks. Each park has a unique distribution, indicating that conservation efforts and challenges vary by location. This can be used to identify parks with higher concentrations of endangered species, which may require more focused conservation efforts.

**<span style="color:blue">2. Correlations Between Species Types and Conservation Status</span>**
- **Contingency Table:** The table shows the counts of different species categories across each conservation status. For example, Vascular Plants dominate the "No Intervention" status, while Mammals and Birds have a more significant presence in categories like "Endangered" and "Species of Concern."
  
- **Chi-square Test:** The p-value obtained from the Chi-square test is extremely low (~2.46e-117), indicating a strong association between species categories and their conservation statuses. This suggests that the type of species significantly influences its likelihood of being endangered or under conservation.

---

**<span style="color:green">Insightful Analysis:</span>**  
These analyses help identify which parks are most at risk and how different species categories are affected by conservation efforts.

---

### Step-by-Step Analysis Plan

**<span style="color:blue">Step 1: Visualize Key Insights</span>**
- **Distribution of Endangered Species Across Parks:**  
  We'll begin by visualizing the distribution of endangered species across parks.

- **Distribution of Species Types Among Endangered Species:**  
  We'll also visualize the distribution of species types among those that are endangered.

**<span style="color:blue">Step 2: Logistic Regression</span>**
- We'll perform logistic regression to predict the likelihood of a species being endangered based on features like species category and observation count.

**<span style="color:blue">Step 3: Decision Tree or Random Forest Classifier</span>**
- Finally, we'll implement a decision tree or random forest classifier to predict the conservation status of species, followed by evaluating the model with a confusion matrix.

---

### Data Visualization

We can create visualizations to highlight key insights such as:

**<span style="color:green">1. Distribution of Endangered Species Across Parks:</span>**
- A bar chart or scatter plot showing the number of endangered species in each park. This can help identify which parks have the highest concentration of endangered species, potentially guiding conservation efforts.

**<span style="color:green">2. Types of Species Most at Risk:</span>**
- A pie chart or bar chart to show the distribution of species types (e.g., Mammals, Birds) among those that are endangered. This can highlight which categories of species are most vulnerable and require the most attention.

---

### Machine Learning and Confusion Matrix

To extend the analysis:

**<span style="color:blue">Logistic Regression (Binary Classification):</span>**
- We could perform logistic regression to predict whether a species is endangered based on features like species category and the number of observations.
- After training the model, a confusion matrix would help evaluate its performance, showing how well the model distinguishes between endangered and non-endangered species.

**<span style="color:blue">Decision Trees or Random Forest:</span>**
- These models can be used for classification tasks to predict conservation status. They could provide insights into which features (like species type, park location, or observation count) are most influential in determining a species' conservation status.
- After model training, the confusion matrix can again be used to evaluate model performance.

To illustrate the overall proportion of each conservation status across all species using a pie chart. This visualization provides a clear overview of how species are distributed among different conservation statuses.

**<span style="color:blue">Insight:</span>**  
This pie chart helps us understand the broader conservation landscape by highlighting which conservation statuses are most prevalent. By visualizing the distribution, we can quickly identify whether most species fall into categories like "Endangered," "Threatened," or "No Intervention," guiding our understanding of where conservation efforts might be most needed.

---


---

### Violin Plot for Observation Counts by Category

**<span style="color:blue">Purpose:</span>**  
To visualize the distribution of observation counts for each species category using a violin plot. This chart provides a detailed view of how observations are spread across different species types.

**<span style="color:blue">Insight:</span>**  
This violin plot reveals how observation efforts are distributed across species categories, potentially highlighting biases in data collection. By identifying categories with disproportionately high or low observation counts, we can assess whether certain species types may be underrepresented or overrepresented in the data, which is crucial for accurate conservation analysis.

### Logistic Regression

**<span style="color:blue">Model Performance:</span>**  
- **F1 Score:** The F1 score of 1.0 suggests that the model perfectly predicted the endangered status in the test set. This might indicate that the data is relatively easy to separate or that the model could be overfitting.

- **Confusion Matrix:** The confusion matrix shows that the model made no errors on the test set, with all predictions being correct (1,741 true negatives and 7 true positives).

---

### Next Steps

**<span style="color:green">Interpretation:</span>**  
While the model’s perfect performance seems impressive, it could also indicate that the model might not generalize well to new data, especially if the dataset is small or unbalanced. It’s important to evaluate this with additional techniques, such as cross-validation.

**<span style="color:green">Decision Tree or Random Forest:</span>**  
To further explore the data, we could implement a decision tree or random forest classifier. These models will allow us to understand the feature importance and possibly uncover more complex patterns.

---

### Steps to Implement the Decision Tree Model

1. **<span style="color:blue">Train the Decision Tree Model:</span>**
   - We'll train a decision tree classifier on the dataset.
   - We'll set parameters like `max_depth` to limit the depth of the tree, which helps prevent overfitting.

2. **<span style="color:blue">Evaluate the Model:</span>**
   - We'll evaluate the model using a confusion matrix and calculate metrics like F1 score.
   - We’ll also look at feature importance to understand which factors contribute most to predicting the endangered status.

3. **<span style="color:blue">Avoiding Overfitting:</span>**
   - **Pruning the Tree:** Set a `max_depth` and `min_samples_split` to prevent the tree from growing too complex.
   - **Cross-Validation:** Use cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.
   - **Random Forest:** Consider implementing a Random Forest model, which averages the predictions of multiple decision trees to reduce the risk of overfitting.

---

### Decision Tree Model Results

**<span style="color:blue">Model Performance:</span>**  
- **F1 Score:** The F1 score for the decision tree model is 0.93, which indicates strong performance, though slightly lower than the logistic regression model. This is generally expected since the decision tree model is more controlled to avoid overfitting.

- **Confusion Matrix:** The confusion matrix shows that the model made one error, misclassifying a single non-endangered species as endangered.

**<span style="color:blue">Cross-Validation:</span>**  
- **Average F1 Score from Cross-Validation:** The mean F1 score from 5-fold cross-validation is approximately 0.87, suggesting that the model generalizes well to unseen data and is not overfitting.

**<span style="color:blue">Feature Importance:</span>**  
- **Importance Values:** The most critical feature for the decision tree was the number of observations (`observations`), as reflected by its high importance score (0.997). Other features were not significantly influential in this particular model.

---

### Avoiding Overfitting

**<span style="color:green">Max Depth and Minimum Samples Split:</span>**  
By setting `max_depth=5` and `min_samples_split=10`, we limited the complexity of the tree, which helps prevent it from becoming too tailored to the training data.

**<span style="color:green">Cross-Validation:</span>**  
The use of cross-validation has provided an additional layer of validation, confirming that the model is likely to perform well on new, unseen data.

   - **Why:** Simplifying the continuous feature might help the model focus on broader patterns and improve interpretability.

4. **<span style="color:green">Target Encoding:</span>**

### Summary of the Analysis

Throughout this project, we explored the biodiversity of national parks by analyzing species conservation statuses and identifying patterns that could inform conservation efforts. Our approach included:

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Addressing missing values and standardizing text data to ensure data integrity.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing the distribution of species across parks and categories, and investigating correlations between species types and conservation statuses.
- **Modeling Techniques:** Implementing logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to predict species endangerment, with careful attention to avoiding overfitting through cross-validation.
- **Feature Engineering:** Experimenting with interaction features to capture more complex relationships, though ultimately finding that they did not significantly enhance model performance.

**<span style="color:green">Conclusion:</span>**  
The Random Forest model consistently delivered strong performance across various tests, demonstrating its robustness in predicting species endangerment. While interaction features did not lead to significant improvements, the process provided valuable insights into feature engineering techniques and their impact on model performance. The results underscore the importance of focusing on key features, such as the number of observations, in conservation modeling.
